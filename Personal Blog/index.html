                        <br> 
                        I am social and hardworking. My passion are computers. I just love to 
                        make software. I am working on my programming skills almost everyday, I like to program in C++ 
                        and I also like front-end programming with HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
                        <br>
                        In my free time I like to play the guitar, I love to listen and play music, it makes me feel
                        good. I started playing the guitar on September of 2021 and since then I have been learning new
                        songs and cords. It helps me as a distraction when I have lots of work to do.
                        <br>
                        At night I work at my father's restraunt. I have been working there since I was 12, so 
                        now I have learned how to deal with costumers of all kinds. In my time there I had to work with many 
                        diffrent types of people so I have got the ability to work in a team.
